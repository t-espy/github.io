            <p>
                I'm honing my expertise in AI engineering, with a focus on building practical, high-performance systems
                for real-world applications. The projects featured here highlight that trajectory â€” from GPU-accelerated
                pipelines for financial
                forecasting and model experimentation, to full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems integrating
                Amazon Bedrock, vector search, and modern web tooling. Each reflects a commitment to production-quality
                engineering, scalable architecture, and meaningful end-to-end integration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each project reflects a balance of clean architecture, computational efficiency, and real-world
                applicability.

                    <a class="contact-link" href="stock-price-predictor.html">Stock Price Predictor â€“ GPU-Accelerated
                        Forecasting Pipeline</a>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built as a high-performance experimentation and inference platform, the Stock Price Predictor
                    enables end-to-end development of predictive models using 5-minute OHLCV data.
                    It supports streamlined data ingestion, feature engineering, and GPU-accelerated training, with
                    ensemble logic that merges both XGBoost and LSTM outputs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform integrates CuPy and TensorFlow for optimized resource use, and applies vectorbt-based
                    backtesting to evaluate generated signals.
                    Grid search runs on GPU to fine-tune hyperparameters with maximum efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This workflow demonstrates modular code structure,
                    performance-aware design, automated logging, and the integration of inference outputs into trading
                    signal logic.

                    A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation demo featuring Python + FastAPI for the API, React +
                    Vite for the UI, Amazon Bedrock (Titan models) for embeddings and text generation, and FAISS for
                    local vector search. The repository includes scripts to extract and chunk documents placed in
                    datastore/ and to build the FAISS index using Bedrock embeddings. You can run the stack locally with
                    Docker or deploy it to AWS via manual scripts or a CloudFormation template, with the deployed UI
                    calling the Bedrock-backed API to answer questions. </p>

                    This standalone web application streamlines the clinical documentation process by integrating
                    cutting-edge speech recognition and AI technologies. It captures real-time transcriptions of
                    clinical encounters using Deepgramâ€™s cloud-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine. The raw
                    transcriptions are then transformed into clear, human-readable clinical reports via
                    ChatGPT, ensuring accuracy and HIPAA-aligned language. Finally, the structured data is
                    seamlessly inserted into an EHR database using Better EHR, enabling efficient, end-to-end
                    documentation workflows for healthcare providers. </p>
